I wanted to understand...
I wanted to understand the real sources of market liquidity. As a long-term 
investor (not a day trader), my goal was to identify optimal entry points 
during major market downturns - based on primary data, not speculation.

I focused on free data from the Federal Reserve and other official sources, 
prioritizing critical indicators over flashy features.

## What Makes This Different

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **83 Indicators** | Fed balance sheet, global M2, credit conditions, sentiment |
| **Liquidity Focus** | Net Liquidity calculation, RMP alerts, ON RRP tracking |
| **Real Monte Carlo** | NumPy/SciPy implementation with EVT, Jump-Diffusion, VaR |
| **AI Analysis** | Evaluates market conditions based on all monitored data |

### Honest Limitations

- Data from free APIs (FRED, Yahoo Finance) - delayed, not real-time
- Personal analysis tool - **not investment advice**
- Maintained by one person - updates may be slow
